![pexels-lt-chan-2833379](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111751273/217878429-b0860c83-7789-4ebb-883c-296cb0cf58e1.jpg)


# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
The air traffic control manager Zaven Galoyan is facing a major challenge in effectively managing and tracking all the relevant data pertaining to airport operations, such as flight numbers, airplane models, destinations, flight schedule, terminal and gate numbers. The current manual system for keeping track of this data is time-consuming, prone to mistakes, and ineffective. The data is easily mixed up and lost, and the urgent need is to create a simple centralized manual system that can assist the air traffic control crew in managing all of this information quickly and effectively without relying on automated inputs.
## Success Criteria
1. The application will have a login system that checks if the email and password submitted is correct with data validation.
2. The application will have a register system that registers the inputted username, email, and password without duplicates.
3. Allow multiple different accounts access the same common database which stores all flight information
4. The application will allow the user to input all attributes (flight number, airplane model, destination, flight schedule, terminal, and gate numbers) and will be stored into the database through the GUI.
5. The application will show all past inputs of all attributes from the database through the GUI.
6. The application will validate all inputs of values for specific attributes to ensure there are no mistakes in data.

## Design Statement 
I plan to develop a system for the air traffic crew that will track all relevant data pertaining to airport operations. To accomplish this, I will design and develope the system using Python, Kivymd, and SQlite to provide a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by the air traffic control in maintaining accurate and up-to-date records of flight information, including airlines, airplanes, destinations, flight timings, terminal and gate numbers, and more. By implementing a centralized manual system, I aim to improve the efficiency and accuracy of tracking this data, reducing the risk of delays, miscommunication, and loss of valuable information. This solution will provide the air traffic control with a reliable and user-friendly tool to manage and track all flight-related information easily, ensuring that airport operations run smoothly and effectively.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution
Considering the challenges my client is facing, in order to effectively track all relevant data related to airport operations, I will develop an easy-to-use centralized manual system that will be designed and developed using Kivymd, Python, and SQLite. This solution is designed to address the challenges faced by the air traffic control in maintaining accurate and up-to-date records of flight information.

Firstly, I decided to use Python because it is the most popular and widely used programming language and it is also among the fastest-growing programming languages in the tech industry [3]. Additionally, according to CodingNomads, 30% of developers wish to learn Python the most [4]. As a result of its widespread use, the program is easier for many developers to understand than languages like C or Javascript. This will benefit the digital ledger being programmed in Python because it makes it simple for upcoming programmers to comprehend the code and advance its development. There are also a wide range of libraries that are available in Python which can be easily accessed using a basic syntax [5].
